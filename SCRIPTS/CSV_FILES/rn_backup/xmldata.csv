SEE SCHEDULE O THE TRAITS OF THE TARGET POPULATION INCLUDE, 40% ARE WHITE, 40% ARE AFRICAN AMERICAN AND 20% ARE HISPANIC. MORE THAN 90% OF THE CLIENTS MEET THE FEDERAL POVERTY GUIDELINES. BASED ON EXPERIENCE AND STUDIES CONDUCTED BY THE SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ADMINISTRATION, ADDICTION MANIFESTS ITSELF VERY DIFFERENTLY FOR WOMEN THAN MEN; THEREFORE, IT IS ALSO ESTIMATED THAT MORE THAN 95% OF THE CLIENTS SERVED THROUGH THE CENTER HAVE EXPERIENCED TRAUMA SUCH AS SEXUAL ASSAULT, DOMESTIC VIOLENCE OR MOLESTATION. FOR THE WOMEN'S RECOVERY CENTER, THE INCREASED DEMAND FOR TREATMENT SERVICES CONTINUES TO CHALLENGE THE ORGANIZATIONAL LEADERSHIP TO REVIEW OUTCOMES, EXPLORE ADDITIONAL SERVICES AND IMPLEMENT PROGRAMMING BASED ON BEST PRACTICE STANDARDS AND EVIDENCE BASED THERAPIES TO ACHIEVE THE NATIONAL OUTCOME MEASURES WHILE ADDRESSING THE INCREASED COMPLEXITIES AND LIFE THREATENING NATURE OF THE DISEASE. THE CENTER HAS ENGAGED AN ARCHITECT TO RECONFIGURE THE BUILDING INTERIOR TO INCREASE THE CAPACITY TO TREAT MORE THAN 400 WOMEN AND FAMILIES PER YEAR AND TO EXPAND THE BREADTH OF THE TREATMENT OPTIONS FOR WOMEN. THE WOMEN'S RECOVERY CENTER HAS ADOPTED PROGRAM TARGETS THAT REQUIRE ALCOHOL AND OTHER DRUG TREATMENT FACILITIES TO ACHIEVE THE NATIONAL OUTCOME MEASURES (NOMS). ALL ALCOHOL AND OTHER DRUG TREATMENT FACILITIES THAT RECEIVE ANY FEDERAL DOLLARS ARE REQUIRED TO ADOPT THE PROGRAM TARGETS. ONE ASPECT OF THE OUTCOME MEASURES REQUIRES THAT 60% OF THE CLIENTS THAT ARE ENGAGED IN TREATMENT REMAIN CLEAN AND SOBER FOLLOWING DISCHARGE. THE WOMEN'S RECOVERY CENTER BOASTS ONE OF THE HIGHEST SUCCESS LEVELS IN CUYAHOGA COUNTY WITH 54% OF THE CLIENTS THAT ARE ENGAGED IN ALCOHOL AND OTHER DRUG TREATMENT SUCCESSFULLY GRADUATING. THE OPIATE CRISIS HAS HAD A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE VOLUME OF CLIENTS, LENGTH OF STAY AND THE WAITING PERIOD TO BE ADMITTED. THIS CHANGE IN THE ADDICTION CULTURE IN NORTHEAST OHIO IS LARGELY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE OVER PRESCRIBING OF NARCOTIC PAIN MEDICATIONS BY PHYSICIANS. WITH THE CLIENTS THAT ARE BEING SERVED, THE DIAGNOSIS OF OPIATE ADDICTION AND POLY SUBSTANCE DEPENDENCY HAS INCREASED TO 87% OF THE TOTAL CLIENTS THAT ARE ENGAGED IN TREATMENT. POLYSUBSTANCE DEPENDENCE IS DIAGNOSED WHEN A CLIENT IS ADDICTED TO TWO OR MORE DRUGS. GIVEN THE INCREASED NEEDS FOR DETOXIFICATION BEDS, THERE ARE INSUFFICIENT VOLUMES OF BEDS FOR DETOXIFICATION. THE DETOX FACILITIES ARE TURNING WOMEN AWAY CITING THAT IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO BE MEDICALLY MONITORED IN A DETOX PROGRAM. WITH EACH PASSING WEEK, THE HEROIN CRISIS CONTINUES TO IMPACT THE LIVES OF WOMEN AND FAMILIES. IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2015, CUYAHOGA COUNTY HAS REPORTED THAT 38-40 INDIVIDUALS HAVE DIED FROM AN OPIATE OR HEROIN OVERDOSE. DURING ONE WEEKEND IN JANUARY, EIGHT INDIVIDUALS SUFFERED FATAL OVERDOSES. MORE WOMEN ARE DYING IN OHIO FROM COMPLICATIONS OF ADDICTION THAN FROM CAR ACCIDENTS, BREAST CANCER AND HOMICIDES COMBINED. PRESCRIPTION DRUGS ARE THE GATEWAY DRUGS THAT ARE LEADING TO CRISIS LEVEL ADDICTION TO HEROIN IN OHIO. THIS CRISIS IS NOT LIMITED TO THE INNER CITY OF CLEVELAND BUT IMPACTS WOMEN AND THEIR FAMILIES AT ALL INCOME AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC BACKGROUND. TO FURTHER COMPLICATE THIS EPIDEMIC, GIVEN THE VOLUME OF ADDICTS, THE DETOXIFICATION FACILITIES IN CUYAHOGA COUNTY ARE NOW TURNING AWAY INDIVIDUALS SEEKING DETOX SERVICES STATING THAT OPIATE AND HEROIN WITHDRAWAL DOES NOT REQUIRE A MEDICALLY MONITORED DETOX AND THE CLIENTS ARE SIMPLY TOLD TO GO HOME AND STOP USING. AS CLIENTS BEGIN TO WITHDRAW, THEY WILL BEGIN DEVELOPING FLULIKE SYMPTOMS. THESE WITHDRAWAL SYMPTOMS PERSIST FOR 7 - 10 DAYS.

We served 24 percent more people in 2014 for a total of 3.3 million unique patients, including 26 percent more Medicaid patients in an environment of decreased reimbursement for government-sponsored medical care.We care about school children who've never seen a dentist, about indigent emergency patients who desperately need follow-up care and for the elderly who need a ride to the doctor or just a friendly phone call to say hello.We are driven by a commitment to the Providence Mission of compassionate care for all, especially the poor and vulnerable, and to our core values of Respect, Compassion, Justice, Stewardship and Excellence.",5443739152,5510335427,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"

Our organization offers four core programs that help low-income women wherever they are in their job search or career path: Business Attire: Our Business Attire program is a gateway to a relationship with our clients, focusing on giving women a sense of empowerment and confidence. We pair un- and under-employed women with image coaches, who help them choose head-to-toe suiting and accessories that are appropriate for an employment interview. Once a woman obtains a job, she is also eligible for employment suiting, which provides her with a week's worth of separates appropriate for her position. In 2014, we completed 734 suiting appointments for unemployed and newly employed women. Going Places Network (GPN): For many of our clients, the GPN is the first commitment they make to gaining financial self-sufficiency. The GPN is an eight-week educational course offered three times annually that provides women with the skills they need to interview well, craft a resume and tailor a cover letter to obtain a job. Over the life of our GPN program, 70 percent of our clients with have reported gaining employment within 90 days of completing the program. Professional Intelligence (PI): PI is a relatively new program, piloted in 2014 and launched in 2015, to help educate low-income women about the personal and career skills they will need to succeed in the workplace and stabilize their families. Professional Women's Group (PWG): The PWG is the final stage of our programs, which helps women develop career focus and sustainability. The PWG is a monthly network that offers continuing education to employed women on critical topics that will help them grow in their careers over time. We view our programs as a continuum, helping women gain confidence as they seek a new job, providing training and skills to succeed in the interview process, developing a strong network of support that helps them retain their jobs, and mentoring them as they transition out of a cycle of low-wage jobs and into a career that will sustain their families for life.

        ","Schedule A, Part I, Line 7:","The following information is submitted to demonstrate that the National Family Planning & Reproductive Health Association (""NFPRHA"") qualifies as a publicly supported charity under sections l70(b)(l)(A)(vi) and 509(a)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code (""Code"") pursuant to the facts and circumstances test described in Treasury Regulations (""Regulations"") section l.l70A-9(f)(3). Background NFPRHA's mission is to coordinate and improve the distribution of family planning services and supplies. NFPRHA is a national leader of the effort to ensure federal policymakers recognize the importance of access to family planning care, a critical primary and preventive health service, for all. NFPRHA's 867 institutional members operate or fund a network of nearly 5,000 health centers providing comprehensive family planning services to millions of low-income and uninsured or underinsured individuals throughout the United States. Founded in 1971, NFPRHA represents the full spectrum of the U.S. family planning field, including administrators, clinicians, researchers, educators, advocates and patients. NFPRHA's members include: state, county and local health departments; community health care centers; the Planned Parenthood Federation of America and many of its affiliates; family planning councils; and non-profit hospital-based health centers. NFPRHA acts as the voice of its members and educates decision-makers who are in positions to impact family planning and sexual health service delivery, on its members' behalf. Application of Facts and Circumstances Test Numerous facts and circumstances justify NFPRHA being treated as a publicly supported charity under section 1.170A-9(f)(3) of the Regulations: Percentage of Public Support, 1.170A-9(f)(3)(i), 1.170A-9(f)(3)(iii)(A) As shown, NFPRHA's public support for the period from 2010 to 2014 is 23.42% which is above the minimum 10% requirement. Therefore, NFPRHA is treated as normally receiving a substantial amount of governmental or public support. 2013 was the first year that NFPRHA fell below 33.3% public support and is taking aggressive steps to increase its public support. In FY2016 NFPRHA will onboard a senior leader in Development and double the size of its development staff to build the foundation for increasing public support over time. The new development team will research and apply to new foundation prospects. The number of corporations that support NFPRHA at low levels of sponsorship has steadily increased over the last five years. The development team will continue this trend and seek additional support from existing corporate supporters. Attraction of Public Support, l.l70A-9(f)(3)(ii) NFPRHA receives support from private foundations, membership dues, Combined Federal Campaign contributions, online donations from individuals, individual and corporate support of its annual national conference and gala, and grants from corporations and other nonprofit organizations. The foundations currently supporting NFPRHA have a diverse set of interests and rationales for supporting NFPRHA's work. While the whole number of private foundations has decreased over the past two years, NFPRHA is actively seeking to expand the number of such funders. In October 2014, NFPRHA added information to its online donation form to facilitate the acceptance of planned gifts. Support for NFPRHA's annual national conference and gala has dramatically increased over the past five years. NFPRHA is currently seeking to replace its departing Director of Development with a more experienced lead development staffer who will be charged with expanding NFPRHA's donor base. It is expected that this position will be filled in early 2016. NFPRHA's development function will be further augmented with the addition of a Manager of Foundation Relations to allow the Vice President of Development to concentrate on increasing non-foundation revenue sources and developing new foundation prospects. Representative Governing Body, l.l70A-9(f)(3)(C) NFPRHA's Board of Directors represents the broad interests of the public and is comprised of family planning clinicians and administrators, health care consultants, hospital administrators, state government employees, and community member with deep knowledge and expertise related to the delivery and administration of publicly funded family planning services. Eighty-six percent of the NFPRHA Board members are either current or former family planning health center administrators or clinicians. The remaining 14% of the Board members are current or former women's health or Medicaid administrators. Members of the NFPRHA Board have diverse backgrounds, perspectives, and experiences, and work with diverse patient populations. They represent geographically diverse areas of the United States, and ensure that the organization reflects the full breadth of the public interest. Availability of Public Services and Public Participation in Programs, l.l70A-9(f)(3)(D) NFPRHA's goals are to improve federal policies in support of publicly funded family planning and sexual health services and support the operations and sustainability of the family planning safety net. In this endeavor, the organization engages the public on different levels, making resources and programs available to them in a number of different ways. NFPRHA publishes a regular newsletter and maintains a website to keep the public informed about the work of NFPRHA and to provide resources for health center administrators, policymakers and the public. Through these vehicles, NFPRHA makes available educational resources produced by NFPRHA, as well as providing links to the work of many partner organizations. The full scope of the publicly available educational materials produced by NFPRHA is too extensive to fully describe here, but one representative resource will serve to illustrate the nature of the work: since 2004 NFPRHA has produced an annual comprehensive review of the previous year's legislative action and regulatory activity related to family planning and sexual health issues. In 2014 the report was updated to provide an in-depth analysis of the state of family planning funding; the highest priority area for family planning administrators and clinicians. NFPRHA also makes information publicly available on how cuts in federal family planning funds have affected communities across the country. Nearly every state has experienced cuts since 2010 and the NFPRHA website provides a detailed breakdown of how funding cuts in each state have impacted the provider network and the public it serves. Each year, NFPRHA organizes three conferences, and organizes and/or participates in many public briefings on Capitol Hill. NFPRHA conferences offer critical education, policy analyses, training, and networking opportunities and is available to the public. On more than 25 occasions each year, NFPRHA staff organize or participate in conferences, panels, trainings, and other events designed to educate and the broader public health community. These events help spread information on a range of topics important to increasing and protecting public access to family planning health care. Conclusion NFPRHA's mission is to promote public access to family planning care by educating policymakers and providing resources to the administrators of publicly funded family planning programs. NFPRHA's concerted effort to diversify its funding and its governing board of family planning administrators and clinicians that reflect the broad concerns and views of the community clearly indicate that NFPRHA satisfies the facts and circumstances test set forth in section l.l70A-9(f)(3) of the Regulations.","

Consistent with our Mission, M&BPN focuses on reducing the incidence of infant mortality and morbidity, improving pregnancy and birth outcomes, and promoting and supporting families. Our programs are multi-faceted and include pre-conception, prenatal and post-partum education, adolescent pregnancy prevention services, outreach and support, infant and toddler information and services, parent support and education, and support for individuals and families needing health care coverage and access to health care services. Mothers & Babies relies on government and foundation grants to provide primary support of our programs. Yet with declining government resources, we are competing for smaller pools of funding and up against the larger metropolitan areas of the state which are being prioritized for services.

We were able to assist with getting health insurance, finding doctors and other health supportive professionals, identifying family planning options and providers, finding housing , setting and achieving goals and providing education on pregnancy, parenting and child development. oOur Perinatal Educators provided 44 professional education opportunities for individuals, groups, and health care professionals on a broad range of topics surrounding pregnancy and early parenting. oMothers & Babies is proud to be the SCNY chapter of the National Cribs for Kids program. We distributed cribs and safe sleep education to 35 families this year who had no personal resources or other way to access a crib for their infant. oOur PAL Centers hosted 582 families this year, serving 835 adults and 1,001 children. More than 100 parents completed formal parenting education programs and an additional 40 parents worked one on one with PAL staff through our individual mentoring program. Families benefitted from a variety of activities and supports as well as had the opportunity to connect and engage with other families while at PAL.
